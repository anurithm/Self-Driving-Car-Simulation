🚗 Self-Driving Car Simulation using Computer Vision

## ⚡ Project Overview
This project simulates a basic self-driving car using computer vision techniques. 
It focuses on **lane detection**, **region of interest (ROI) selection**, and **steering logic** to demonstrate vehicle navigation using video input.

## 📚 Problem Statement
Self-driving cars require real-time understanding of road lanes to navigate safely. 
Manually controlling lane detection and steering logic is impractical for simulations. 
This project automates lane detection and simulates steering decisions for a self-driving car.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect road lanes using computer vision 🛣️  
- Apply region-of-interest (ROI) for focused processing 🎯  
- Implement simple steering logic (Go Straight / Turn Left / Turn Right / Stop) 🔄  
- Simulate self-driving behavior on video input 🎥  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib (optional)
